- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NaNcharString. I was born in France in 1981.
Former high-level badminton athlete, I obtained a master's degree in Science and Technique of Physical and Sports Activities at the University of OrlÃ©ans(France) in 2004. 
Subsequently I resumed my studies and obtained a master's degree in physiotherapy at the University of LiÃ¨ge(Belgium) in 2009. 
Finally, I resumed my studies again to obtain a diploma in osteopathy at the school of Rennes(France) in 2019. 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer language and its wide applications. 
- ğŸŒ± I am currently self-learning php, javascript, jquery,database management (sql), java languages. 
My level is not pretentious but I am thirsty to improve myself and learn new languages (python for example).
